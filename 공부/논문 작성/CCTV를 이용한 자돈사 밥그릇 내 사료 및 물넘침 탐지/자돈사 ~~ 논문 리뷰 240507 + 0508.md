그림 5를 좀 더 키워줄 것


서론에서 설명할때 인력에 대한 문제~~~ 제시
후 센서에 대한 문제 제시~~~ 할것 같은데
센서에 대한 문제 제시가 아니라 설명이 나와서 문맥이 맞지 않다

Water and feed which directly affect livestock productivity, are detected using CCTV video data and a semantic segmentation model. Due to decreased accuracy in segmentation when performing it on original data, this research proposes a method of overlapping multiple segmentation maps to pre-locate specific areas and utilize this information in subsequent segmentation tasks. For experimentation, the DeepLabv3+ semantic segmentation model was employed. The accuracy of bowl location detection by the model reached its highest performance with an mIoU of 0.811 when utilizing the ResNet-101 backbone. The detection accuracy of water and feed reached an mIoU of 0.76. It is expected that by collecting more data and enhancing accuracy, operational tasks on farms could be reduced in the future.
